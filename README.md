###The Problem
Today more than ever there is an upwelling in attention to pet adoption from either shelters or rescue organizations. In 2015 - 2016, dog and cat adoption from a shelter or rescue organization rose by over 40% from 2012/2013. This is a wonderful trend that helps reduce the 'mills' that foster a poor environment for the animals.

However for all of the adoptions that are happening, the majority of them are younger animals, puppies or adolescents. The smaller end of the spectrum are considered adult animals and the smallest percentage of those animals are seniors. Even smaller are the ones with special needs.

But those animals need love and care just as much as a puppy does. Some have lived hard lives, rejected by everyone. They only want the same thing any animal wants: love, shelter, food, safety. They want to be cared for. They deserve a safe and loving home to spend the rest of their lives in.

The Gently Used Pets project seeks to alleviate this by bringing those animals to the forefront of a pet adoption search.

###The Solution
The team will develop a web based application that will allow a user to search for a senior or special needs pet. Each day, a new selection of pets will be featured as well. Users will be able to view details of each animal including contact information for the shelter or rescue organization currently housing the animal. The site will also provide information regarding care of the animal as well as links to organizations that can help with living/medical expenses and that provide any special equipment the pet could potentially need to make their life the best it possibly can.
